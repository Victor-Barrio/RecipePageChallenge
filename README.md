## My process

### What I learned

I continued practicing the Mobile-first workflow for doint this project. At the starts of the project, I was struggling with the CSS to look good on both views, but I was able to do it by struggling a little bit. I also learned how to use the Flexbox to make the recipe page look good on mobile and desktop.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing all the things I learned in this project. For in the future do it better and do it faster.
